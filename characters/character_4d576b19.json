    "full_description": "Lyra Silvertongue carries an air of quiet intensity, her presence as crisp and clear as a Nordic winter morning. Her sharp, intelligent sapphire-blue eyes, capable of both piercing scrutiny and profound empathy, are the focal point of a face framed by intricately braided silver hair. These elaborate plaits speak of patience and a meticulous nature, contrasting with the light, almost youthful dusting of freckles scattered across her straight nose and high cheekbones. A determined chin hints at an unyielding will, a resolve perhaps tested, as suggested by the faint, silvery scar that arcs delicately above her left eyebrow \u2013 a subtle mark of a past encounter.\n\nHer slender yet athletic build allows her to move with a quiet grace, an agile fluidity that makes her seem almost ethereal at times, yet always grounded. She is observant and thoughtful, her gaze often lingering, absorbing details with a silent acuity. Around her neck, always present, rests a moonstone pendant. The cool, milky glow of the stone seems to echo the silver of her hair and the scar, a constant, personal emblem against the practical fabrics she likely favors. Lyra's demeanor is one of watchful stillness, a woman who listens more than she speaks, her every subtle movement hinting at a life lived with awareness and resilience. She now also carries an ornate, ancient dagger at her hip.",
