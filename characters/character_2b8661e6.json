    "full_description": "Lyra Silvertongue, at twenty-eight, carries the keen air of the northern winds in her very bearing. Her sapphire-blue eyes, sharp and intensely intelligent, miss little, sweeping over her surroundings with a quiet, assessing gaze. A light constellation of freckles dusts the bridge of her straight nose, a stark contrast to the high, sculpted cheekbones that speak of her Nordic-inspired heritage. Her silver hair, the color of winter moonlight, is a marvel of intricate braids, each strand meticulously woven, hinting at a disciplined and patient nature.\n\nHer slender frame, though seemingly delicate, possesses an underlying athleticism, an agile grace evident in every fluid movement. She moves with the hushed poise of a forest creature, observant and thoughtful, her presence often felt before it is seen. A faint, silvery scar, like a sliver of moonlight itself, arcs just above her left eyebrow, a silent testament to a past encounter that has only sharpened her determined chin. Around her neck, a moonstone pendant always rests, its milky depths seeming to capture and reflect the ambient light, a constant companion and perhaps a source of quiet strength. She now also carries an ornate, ancient dagger at her hip.",
