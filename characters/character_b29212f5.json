Her sharp, intelligent sapphire-blue eyes are the immediate focal point of a face defined by high cheekbones and a determined chin. A light dusting of freckles across her straight nose adds a touch of unexpected softness to an otherwise resolute expression. Her silver hair, the color of winter moonlight, is rarely left unbound, instead woven into intricate braids that speak of patience and tradition.\n\nShe moves with a quiet, almost feline grace, her slender yet athletic build suggesting a life of activity and readiness. There's an observant stillness about her, a thoughtfulness that seems to absorb every detail of her surroundings. Always present is a moonstone pendant, resting against her collarbone, its milky luminescence a constant companion. Above her left eyebrow, a faint, silvery scar cuts a delicate line \u2013 a subtle testament to a past that has clearly shaped, but not diminished, her keen spirit. Lyra's presence is one of understated strength, a blend of keen intellect and agile physicality, hinting at a depth of experience belied by her years. She now also carries an ornate, ancient dagger at her hip.",
