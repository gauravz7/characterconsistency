Her Nordic heritage is etched into the high cheekbones and the determined line of her chin, features that stand out against the intricate braids of her striking silver hair. Sharp, intelligent sapphire-blue eyes are her most compelling trait, constantly observing, their depths hinting at a keen mind. A light dusting of freckles across her straight nose offers a subtle counterpoint to her otherwise resolute expression.\n\nA faint, silvery scar arcs just above her left eyebrow, a silent testament to a past not easily forgotten, yet it does nothing to detract from her focused gaze. Always present is a moonstone pendant, nestled at her throat, its ethereal glow seeming to mirror the thoughtful, observant nature that defines her. Lyra carries herself with a quiet confidence, a woman who listens more than she speaks, her every subtle movement and keen glance suggesting a depth of experience and a sharp intellect carefully held in reserve. She now also carries an ornate, ancient dagger at her hip.",
